									<h1>What can this do?<br />
									</h1>
									<p>The possibilities are endless!</p>
									<p>This image shows how sound looks with cymatics!</p>

								<p>We have all heard that classical music is good for concentration. The blues during a difficult time. Lets add some scientific proof to these claims!</p>
								<h2>What is Frequency?</h2>
								<p>Simply put frequncy is sound. It goes deeper that that though. Everything is frequency. Solid objects like your chair, wireless signals, such as the ones your phone run off of. Even light and energy all have their frequency! Gaining a better understanding of frequency, cymatics, and sound could be the key to understand our universe!</p>
								<h3>What is Sound?</h3>
								<p>Sound is a vibration moving through a medium like air, water, or solid objects.</p>
								<p>When something vibrates—like a guitar string—it pushes air molecules back and forth.</p>
								<p>Our ears pick up those vibrations as sound.</p>
								<p>Key point: Sound = vibration in matter.</p>
								<h3>What is Light?</h3>
								<p>Light is not a vibration in air—it’s a vibration of the electromagnetic field.</p>
								<p>It doesn’t need air or water to travel; it can move through space.</p>
								<p>The color of light depends on its frequency:</p>
								<p>Low frequency = red</p>
								<p>High frequency = violet</p>
								<p>Key point: Light = vibration of energy fields.</p>
								<h3>What is Matter?</h3>
								<p>Matter feels solid, but on the smallest scale it’s made of particles like electrons and quarks.</p>
								<p>These particles behave both like particles and waves.</p>
								<p>Their energy levels are described by frequency.</p>
								<p>In some theories (like string theory), matter itself is thought to be made of tiny vibrating “strings.”</p>
								<p>Key point: Matter = vibration in quantum fields.</p>
								<h3>The Common Thread: Frequency</h3>
								<p>Sound: vibration in air or another medium.</p>
								<p>Light: vibration of electromagnetic fields.</p>
								<p>Matter: vibration of quantum fields.</p>
								<p>In physics, energy is tied directly to frequency (through the equation E = hf). This means that how much energy something has is literally defined by its vibration.</p>
								<h2>Cymatics and the Nature of Reality</h2>
								<h3>What is Cymatics?</h3>
								<p>Cymatics is the study of how sound vibrations create visible patterns, such as the images on this page.</p>
								<p>Example: sprinkle sand on a metal plate, play a tone, and the sand arranges into geometric shapes.</p>
								<p>Different frequencies create different patterns—some simple, some very complex.</p>
								<h3>Why Does It Matter?</h3>
								<p>Cymatics shows us that vibration shapes matter.</p>
								<p>Invisible sound waves cause visible order.</p>
								<p>It’s a direct demonstration that frequency can structure the physical world.</p>
								<h3>How It Connects to Sound, Light, and Matter</h3>
								<p>Sound: Cymatics directly uses sound to show patterns.</p>
								<p>Light: Light itself is a vibration, just at much higher frequencies than sound. Imagine if we could “see” electromagnetic vibrations the same way—we’d see patterns everywhere.</p>
								<p>Matter: On the quantum scale, particles are like standing waves. Cymatics is a macro-scale analogy, showing how vibration gives matter form.</p>
								<h3>The Big Idea</h3>
								<p>Cymatics is a visual metaphor for how the universe works:</p>
								<p>Frequency → Creates structure</p>
								<p>Vibration → Shapes energy into form</p>
								<p>Patterns → Become the building blocks of what we see as reality</p>
								<p>It suggests that all forms, from snowflakes to galaxies, may be organized by vibration in some way.</p>
								<h2>Takeaway</h2>
								<p>Cymatics shows, in a hands-on way, what physics and metaphysics both suggest:</p>
								<p>Everything is frequency, and vibration has the power to shape matter and energy into form.</p>
